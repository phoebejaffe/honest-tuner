- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient audio processing with minimal latency

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Modern web browser with microphone access
- HTTPS connection (required for microphone access in most browsers)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd honest-tuner
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

5. Allow microphone access when prompted

## üé§ How to Use

1. **Start Listening**: Click the "üé§ Start Listening" button
2. **Sing or Speak**: The app will detect your voice pitch in real-time
3. **View Results**: See the current note and frequency displayed prominently
4. **Watch the Graph**: Observe your pitch changes over time in the scrolling graph
5. **Transpose (Optional)**: Click "I'm totally not lying to you" to reveal transpose controls

## üîß Technical Details

### Pitch Detection Algorithm

- **Autocorrelation**: Implements autocorrelation for robust pitch detection
- **Voice Optimization**: Filtered for human voice range (80Hz - 800Hz)
- **Real-time Processing**: Uses Web Audio API with 2048 sample FFT
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for minimal delay between input and output

### Audio Processing

- **Sample Rate**: Adapts to system audio sample rate
- **Buffer Size**: 2048 samples for optimal accuracy vs. performance
- **Smoothing**: 0.8 smoothing constant for stable readings

### Graph Visualization

- **Octave Looping**: Y-axis loops every octave for intuitive pitch representation
- **Time Scrolling**: X-axis shows last 10 seconds of pitch data
- **Dot Rendering**: Individual pitch points rendered as small dots
- **Grid Lines**: Dashed lines showing octave boundaries

## üéµ Musical Features
